🚀 React Event Handler Project 🎯

In this mini React project, I implemented basic event handling using two interactive buttons: Next ➡️ and Previous ⬅️. These buttons allow users to navigate through content dynamically by updating state in real-time using React's useState() hook.

The project is designed to showcase how React handles user interactions, making the UI responsive and interactive. It’s a perfect example of using onClick events in React for beginners. 🌟

✅ Features:

Dynamic content change based on button click 🎛️

Clean and responsive component structure 🧼

Simple and effective use of state and events ⚡

💻 Tech Stack: React.js, JSX, CSS
